[{"prompt":"Sup fella","alpaca":", I am new to the forums here.\r\nI just joined in order to ask a question that has been bothering me since yesterday afternoon: Why do people think it's okay? Why is there such an expectation among us humans (more specifically westerners) that someone can be disrespected or insulted and then forgive their attacker without recourse, simply because the person apologized for whatever they did.\r\nI understand if you are referring to a criminal justice system - like when I was speeding in my car yesterday afternoon on one of those busy highways where people tend to drive recklessly (not me!). It is pretty normal here that once caught by police, we have this notion \"you can get out with it\" as long as you are willing and able to pay up your traffic ticket. I don't necessarily support or disagree - but what annoyed/bothered my about yesterday was when someone insults me online in their anger (and yes they were angry) by making some rude comments directed at people who look differently than them, saying that these kind of ppl are 'bad humans'. It'll be pretty hard to find anyone not offended if you say something like this. However as soon as I asked for an apology - the person refused and simply said \"you shouldn't take it personally\".\r\nTo summarize: Why is apologizing supposedly enough? Do we really expect people will forgive someone without getting some form of retribution (even emotional)? Is there something wrong with our human psyche that makes this notion so prevalent in the West, but yet unheard off anywhere else on Earth.\r\nI would be grateful for anyone's perspective and any thoughts you may have to share :) Thank You! \r\n\n\n\n"},{"prompt":"How much is 2+2?
